# Movie-Drink Matchmaker

## Description
We created a movie night application that provides the user with a movie and drink recommendation based on their selections. Here's how this application works:

1. User selects a movie genre AND a drink type.
2. When the user clicks the submit button, they're presented with the most popular movie in the genre and a random drink in their selected type.
3. If the user wants a different movie in the genre, they can click the "New Movie" button.
4. If the user wants a different drink in the same category, they can click the "New Drink" button.
5. When the user finds a pair they like, they can click the "Save to Favorites" button so save them to localStorage.
6. Saved combinations can be found on the "Favorites" page.
